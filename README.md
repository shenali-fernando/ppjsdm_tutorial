# ppjsdm_tutorial
This repo contains a four-part in-depth tutorial for using the ppjsdm package that contains the saturated pairwise interaction Gibbs points process model with an example dataset.I recommend moving through the tutorial in order. 

Part 1 gives package installation help as well as code and explanation of the various parameters and how to assign values to these. Part 2 shows how to fit the model and some common errors that might occur at this stage. Part 3 gives examples of visualisation of the coefficients including coefficient plots, heat maps, chord diagrams, and also how to extract coefficients into a dataframe to customise other plots. Lastly Part 4 shows how to predict using the model, and goes through computing and understanding the log-Papangelou conditional intensity, computing AUC scores and comparing to the Poisson model. 

More examples of fitting the ppjsdm model to other datasets are given in the folder marked 'other_examples'. These examples tend to be simpler systems and use data freely available from R. Lastly, the PPJSDM_model_overview.doc gives an explanation of the model and its parameters and how everything comes together.
