# ppjsdm_tutorial
This repo contains a four-part in-depth tutorial for using the ppjsdm package that contains the saturated pairwise interaction Gibbs points process model with an example dataset.

I recommend moving through the tutorial in order. Part 1 gives code and explanation of the various parameters and how to assign values to these. Part 2 shows how to fit the model and some common errors that might occur at this stage. Part 3 gives examples of visualisation of the coefficients including coefficient plots, heat maps, chord diagrams, and also how to extract coefficients into a dataframe to customise other plots. Lastly Part 4 shows how to predict using the model, and goes through computing and understanding the log-Papangelou conditional intensity, creating AUC scores and comparing to the Poisson model. 

More examples of fitting the ppjsdm model to other datasets are given in the folder marked 'other_examples'.
